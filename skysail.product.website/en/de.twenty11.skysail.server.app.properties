de.twenty11.skysail.server.app.tutorial.model2rest.home.TutorialHomeResource.message=renderer\:markdown \#\#\# Getting Started Guide - An intro example for skysail\r\n\r\nThis guide will help you understand what skysail is about and how to get your feet wet with its concepts.\r\n\r\nAs syksail is about **creating RESTful applications from domain models**, we&\#39;ll show you how a simple &\#34;todo&\#34; model is extended in six steps to create a running Todo-List application, including validation and persistence.\r\n\r\nYou don&\#39;t need to download anything to follow this guide; simply have a look at the models and, if you like, launch the corresponding applications for each step.\r\n\r\n\#\#\#\# The final Model\r\n\r\n\![TodoModel](/website/img/TodoModel.png)\r\n\r\n\#\#\#\# Resources\r\n\r\nTo be honest, you need a little bit more than just a model or two to create a useful application. Some glue code is needed to make your model instances behave the way you want. Initially,Â this code can be generated. Once you need more sophisticated logic, you&\#39;ll take over.\r\n\r\n\#\#\#\# The user interface\r\n\r\nskysails user interface is purely generic and meant to be used by admins, developers and support staff. If you need a client GUI, try some of the fancy javascript frameworks (or anything that supports HTTP) and communicate with the skysail server backend via JSON.
