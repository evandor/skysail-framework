.Contents
Document all important design decisions and their reasons!

.Motivation
It is advantageous if all important design decisions can be found in one place. It is up to you to decide if a decision should be documented here or rather locally (e.g. in the white box descriptions of building blocks). In any case avoid redundancies.

.Form
Informal list, if possible ordered by the decisionsâ€™ importance for the reader. Use the following template to structure your decisions.
