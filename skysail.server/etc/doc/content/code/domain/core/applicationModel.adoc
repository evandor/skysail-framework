== Overview

The Application Model describes the core domain of skysail.

The central part of the the model is the *application*: it's a collection of *entities* and (aggregate) *repositories*. The entities themselves
hold multiple *fields* (describing their properties), and, each of them, *four resources* to handle GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
